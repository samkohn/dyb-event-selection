ToyMC configuration files in toySpectra/data_file:
no fluctuations: dyb_data_v1_nominal.txt
full experiment with fluctuations: dyb_data_v1_allsys_and_stat.txt
in between: other files

Copy the desired template file before making edits.
This file is where you change the "true" oscillation parameters,
and tweak which systematics & statistics are fluctuated.

Data set configuration files in input (Theta13-inputs_*.txt):
ToyMC spectra are scaled to match the given total bg counts.
Signal counts are determined by the above-supplied oscillation parameters.
To turn off bg, set the appropriate row(s) to 0.
Note that just setting row 9 to 0 will not work. Each source of bg must be disabled.
Also note that there's a row for Delta M^2_{32} which is ignored.

cd toySpectra

To generate fewer ToyMC samples:
edit toySpectra/genToySpectraTree.C line 22, e.g. nToys = 1;
